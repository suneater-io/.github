## Hey, I'm suneater.io 👋

also known as Grant

Ever meet someone who genuinely enjoys solving messy problems? That’s me.
I work at the intersection of AI, contact centres, and healthcare tech, full stack networking and I like turning complicated workflows into something that actually makes sense.

If you want the longer version of who I am and what I’m about, head to https://suneater.io.

⚡ What I Do

You know how some people take things apart just to understand them?
Well… I do that, but with:

Webex Contact Center

AI agent design

Healthcare integrations

Automations that probably shouldn’t work this well

Random personal projects I build because I can

I like making systems smarter, faster, and easier to live with.
And I have a habit of thinking way too much about how tech should work, not just how it does.
